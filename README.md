# Game of Life in Rust with Slint

This project implements the [Game of Life of Conway](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juego_de_la_vida) in the Rust programming language using the 
Slint graphics library. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton developed by John Conway in 1970 and is a classic example of dynamical systems.
In addition, the repository aims to learn the basic syntax of the Rust programming language, using libraries such as regex, csv and rand.

## Characteristics

- Slint-based graphical interface to view the game.
- Reading csv files.
- Mathematical calculator using regular expressions with regex.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Rust installed. If you don't have it yet, you can install it by following the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuusuario/Life-Game---Slint-Rust.git
cd Life-Game---Slint-Rust
```

Compile the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Use
Run the program with:
```bash
cargo run --release
```
Once the program is executed, you will be able to interact with the graphical interface and click on the "INIT" button to
See the evolution of the random automaton.
